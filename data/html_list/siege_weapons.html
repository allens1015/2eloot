The barrel of the Steelheart 21 is suspended in a mix of alchemical fluids that first compress to dampen the recoil when fired, then expand to push the barrel back into place afterwards. The result reduces the amount of time needed to reset the aim of the siege weapon. The crew member who launches the Steelheart 21 can use the Quick Aim reaction (below), allowing them to adjust the weapon's aim on the fly as they fire to adapt to a faulty initial target, changing battlefield conditions, the use of illusions by the enemy, or any of a variety of other factors that lead to the need to alter the siege weapon's course.<br><br> <b>Quick Aim</b>  <span class="action action-4" title="Reaction" role="img" aria-label="Reaction"> </span>  <b>Trigger</b> You Launch this siege weapon, after determining the effects of the Launch action. <b>Effect</b> You Aim this siege weapon, moving the aim up to 10 feet instead of its normal distance.<br> <b>Aim</b>  <span class="action action-2" title="Two Actions" role="img" aria-label="Two Actions"> </span>  100 feet, minimum distance 150 feet<br> <b>Load</b>  <span class="action action-2" title="Two Actions" role="img" aria-label="Two Actions"> </span>  (<a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Traits.aspx?ID=104">manipulate</a>) 3 times, requires a successful DC 20 <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Skills.aspx?ID=3">Athletics</a> check<br> <b>Launch</b> <span class="action action-1" title="Single Action" role="img" aria-label="Single Action"> </span>  (<a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Traits.aspx?ID=104">manipulate</a>, <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Traits.aspx?ID=248">range increment 500 feet</a>) 8d12 bludgeoning, 20-foot burst, DC 30 Reflex<h2 class="title"><a href="SiegeWeapons.aspx?ID=20">Alkenstar Cannon</a><span style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:0">Item 15</span></h2><span alt="Rare Trait" class="traitrare" title="This rarity indicates that a rules element is very difficult to find in the game world.
