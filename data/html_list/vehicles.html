If you leave <i>Bunta</i> or are killed, any creatures in your soul immediately exit your body into the nearest available space.

A clockwork creature must be wound regularly to function. 

Clockwork items are Intricate, complex machines that use clockwork to function. Not all require daily winding, but those that do have the wind-up ability in their stat blocks.

Wind-Up: To remain operational, a clockwork vehicle or creature must be wound with a unique key by a creature. This takes an amount of time listed in the clockwork's wind-up entry, which also lists how long the clockwork remains operational once wound; after this duration, the clockwork becomes inactive and immobile until it's wound again. Some clockworks' abilities require them to spend some of their remaining operational time. They can't spend more than they have and shut down immediately once they have 0 time remaining. If it's unclear when a clockwork was last wound, most are re-wound approximately halfway through their operating time.

 A clockwork vehicle can be placed into standby mode by its pilot as a 3-action activity; a clockwork creature must perform this activity itself. A clockwork's operational time doesn't decrease in standby.

 A creature can attempt to Disable a Device to wind a clockwork down (with a DC listed in the wind-up entry)."><a href="Traits.aspx?ID=331">Clockwork</a></span><br><b>Source</b> <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq027kc" target="_blank" class="external-link"><i>Grand Bazaar pg. 22</i></a><br><b>Price</b> 2,100 gp<hr><b>Space</b> 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, 8 feet high<br><b>Crew</b> 1 pilot, 2 crew; <b>Passengers</b> 1<br><b>Piloting Check</b> <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Skills.aspx?ID=4">Crafting</a> (DC 28) or <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Skills.aspx?ID=8">Driving Lore</a> (DC 26)<hr><b>AC</b> 23; <b>Fort</b> +18<br><b>Hardness</b> 5, <b>HP</b> 120 (BT 60); <b>Immunities</b> object immunities; <b>Weaknesses</b> <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Traits.aspx?ID=56">electricity</a> 10 until <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Conditions.aspx?ID=2">broken</a><hr><b>Speed</b> fly 30 feet (clockwork)<br><b>Collision</b> 4d10 (DC 26)<br><b>Wind-Up</b> (10-minute wind, 10-minute operation, DC 26, standby) Like all clockwork vehicles, a clockwork bumblebee must be wound up in order to operate, and a creature can decrease the operation time by 10 minutes with a successful <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="Actions.aspx?ID=69">Disable Device</a> check at the listed DC.
